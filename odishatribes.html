    <h4 style="text-decoration: dashed;font-weight: 600; font-size: 23px;">The Saura Tribe: A Deeper Dive</h4>
        <p class="para">The Sora (alternative names and spellings include Saora, Saura, Savara and Sabara) are a Munda ethnic group from eastern India. They live in southern Odisha and north coastal Andhra Pradesh.The Soras mainly live in Gajapati, Rayagada and Bargarh districts of Odisha.[2] They are also present in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts. In the census, however, some Soras are classified under Shabar or Lodha, the name for another very different Munda tribe. They inhabit blocks of Gunupur, Padmapur and Gudari. Their highest concentration is found in the Puttasingi area, approximately 25 km away from Gunupur NAC. Although, they are close to the assimilation process, yet some interior GPs like Rejingtal, Sagada and Puttasingi have Soras who still retain their traditional tribal customs and traditionsThey are known by various names such as Savara, Sabara, Sora, and Soura. They are concentrated in parts of Gunupur adjoining to the blocks of Gumma, Serango of Gajapati district. The Soras speak Sora, a Munda language. However, written language in Sora is not followed by all. They practice shifting cultivation, with a few gradually taking up settled agriculture.</p>
        Here's a deeper dive into various aspects of their lives:
    <h4 style="font-size: 23px;font-weight:600">History:<hr></h4>
    
        <p class="para">The Soras were already mentioned under the name of Savaras in BrƒÅhma·πáas, who associate them with the Indo-Aryan Vaidarbhas and non-Indo-Aryan Pulindas.  Graeco-Roman authors later mentioned the Soras, with Pliny calling them the "Suari" and Ptolemy calling them the "Sabarae <img src="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262900364/figure/fig2/AS:669393050673156@1536607148099/FIGIGURE-2-DISTRIBUTION-PRIMITIVE-TRIBAL-GROUPS-AND-THEIR-POPULATION-IN-DIFFERENT.png" alt="origin" ALIGN="right" HSSPACE="20px" width="400px">They are of medium or short stature. The Savara villages consist of houses with mud walls and sedge grass roofs, usually situated in foothills. The adult males dress with a gavancha and the women with saris. They are also sometimes called Lanjia Souras due to their dress pattern of wearing a loin cloth hanging from behind and which could be mistakenly identified as a tail by a stranger.They are endogamous and the clan, although absent, is related to Birinda, which is exogamous. Families are nuclear although joint or extended families are also found. Marriages are made by bride capture, elopement, and by negotiations.The Sora people are a dwindling jungle tribe with a distinctive shamanic culture. According to an article in Natural History, "a shaman, usually a woman, serves as an intermediary between the two worlds [of the living and the dead]. During a trance, her soul is said to climb down terrifying precipices to the underworld, leaving her body for the dead to use as their vehicle for communication. One by one the spirits speak through her mouth. Mourners crowd around the shaman, arguing vehemently with the dead, laughing at their jokes, or weeping at their accusations."</p>
   <h4 style="font-size: 23px;font-weight: 600;">Origin and distribution:</h4><hr>
   <p class="para">The Saura tribe, also known as Savara or Sabara, is believed to be one of the oldest indigenous tribes in India. Their origin can be traced back to the prehistoric period, and they are considered to be one of the original inhabitants of the Indian subcontinent. The exact origins of the Saura tribe are not well-documented, but they are believed to have inhabited the hilly and forested regions of present-day Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and parts of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand for centuries.In terms of distribution, the Saura tribe primarily resides in the tribal-dominated districts of Odisha, such as Koraput, Rayagada, Malkangiri, and Gajapati. They also have a presence in the adjacent regions of Andhra Pradesh and parts of Chhattisgarh. Within these areas, the Saura tribe typically inhabits remote and forested areas, where they maintain their traditional way of life and cultural practices.
    Over the years, the Saura tribe has faced various challenges, including displacement, marginalization, and encroachment on their lands. Despite these challenges, they continue to preserve their cultural heritage and maintain their distinct identity as one of the indigenous tribes of the region. Efforts have been made by government agencies, NGOs, and tribal welfare organizations to support the Saura tribe in terms of education, healthcare, and socio-economic development while respecting their unique cultural traditions and way of life.</p>
   <h4 style="font-size: 23px;font-weight: 600;margin-bottom: 0;">Language:</h4><hr>
<p class="para">The Saura language belongs to the Dravidian language family and is primarily spoken by the Saura tribe in Odisha and adjacent regions. It is classified as a South Dravidian language and shares some linguistic similarities with other Dravidian languages spoken in the region. The language may have multiple dialects spoken by different subgroups within the Saura community.</p>

            <p class="para">The pot is called Sonumdung which means food pot of the Sonums. Many in-house rituals are performed near the icon out of which first harvesting festivals of Raganabdar (red gram) and udaanabdar (mango) are compulsory to perform near the Idital. The art is regarded as sacred in Saora religion which represents the house of deities and spirits.Saoras are fun loving people. Drinking tadi (a local wine) in groups is part of their life. The wine drips out overnight from toddy trees into suspended pots. The sap of the alin keeps flowing by incisions made at the inflorescences of the tree. It is fermented by airborne yeasts to produce foaming toddy which is rich in vitamins and mildly alcoholic.</p>

            <p class="para">It is usually the evening after finishing the day‚Äôs chores, the Saura men and women get-together for the drinking party. They spend hours at leisure with friends and relatives to celebrate their evenings with tadi in hands. However it was morning hours, we were welcome to the drinking site on a hill slope surrounded by wooded forests. The drinking site was a circle of flat stones set up as seats around a hearth. The first man who arrived at the site lit the fire. In a few moments, space was filled by his companions, all in their traditional clothing. They poured their tadi into a large pot set over the fire. When the drink was at right lukewarm temperature, one of the men dipped in a gourd ladle and passed it to his neighbour on right, who drank it, refilled it and passed it on again. I also had my term.

            <p class="para"> For recreations, Lanjia Saoras are always ready. All around the year as Saoras say, work keep continue and does not leave them completely free. They are always busy with some work. But whenever they get breaks while in the fields or in the forest, they enjoy the dance and singing. When you drive through their hills in dark night hours you would be enthralled listening to their enchanting music coming from the hilltops accompanied with songs and dances. Their musical instruments include drums, gagerai, tretepe, and jambugrai. During a performance, the surrounding environment of forest and fields get enthralled and romanticized. It is the women folk who sing and dance but the music is led by men only.</p>

            <p class="para"> it was before the tadi party they performed their dance wearing their traditional costumes and attires, for women, a waistcloth with gray borders hardly touching up to their knees and blouse. A major draw of these women were their traditional pieces of jewelry, necklaces of beads, round wooden plugs pierced through their ears, spiral metal rings as ear lobes, hairpins of bell metal, brass rings around their necks and metal anklets and finger rings. The male dancers were marked with their long ended loincloths and had decorated their heads with white fowl feathers and peacock plumes. While dancing they carried swords, sticks, umbrellas and other implements and blew whistles and made peculiar sounds.</p><br>
    <h5 style="font-size: 24px;margin-bottom: 0;">Religion</h5><hr>

    <p class="para">The Soras are highly religious with each and every natural phenomenon attributed to the works of some Gods, deities or spirits of traditional belief. Therefore, the customary law, values, norms are highly respected by all members of the society for the fear of inviting personal or communal harms. They believe that spirits guide their destiny, worshiping mainly the deities Sandhidemudu and Jakaradevatha. According to the legend, Lord Nrusimha was being worshipped at Neelagiri (Puri) along with Neelamadhaba. As mentioned earlier, Lord Nrushimha is being worshiped in a separate temple adjacent to Muktimandapa/ Muktamandapa. According to the legend, the image of Neelamadhaba was made of Neelakanta mani (emerald). However, the present image of the deity is made of neem wood. Legend further says that Lord Jagannath was originally worshiped by a Savara raja (an aboriginal tribal chieftain) named Viswabasu. Having heard about the glory of the deity, Raja Indradyumna sent a Brahmin priest called Vidyapati to discover the exact location of the deity who was then secretly worshipped by Viswabasu inside the cave of a dense forest. Vidyapati tried his best, but could not locate the place of worship. Finally, he could manage to marry Lalita, the daughter of Viswabasu. At repeated request of Lalita, Viswabasu took his son-in-law blind-folded to a cave wherein Lord Neelamadhaba was being worshipped. Vidyapati was a very intelligent man. He dropped mustard seeds on the ground on his way. After a few days, the seeds germinated which helped Vidyapati to locate the cave wherein the deity was being worshiped in secret. On hearing from Vidyapati subsequently, Raja Indradyumna immediately rushed to Odra desa (Odisha) to have a darshan of the deity. The king was disappointed at the sudden disappearance of the deity. The deity was hidden in sand. Raja Indradyumna was determined not to return without having a darshan of the deity and observed fast onto death at Neelagiri. The deity was pleased with the king. Thereafter, the king performed a horse sacrifice and built a mgnificent temple for the deity.However, in the last many decades many of the traditional Sora beliefs have been superseded by Christianity that was introduced by missionaries. In many areas the shamanic and animist beliefs are distant memories, and in some areas, particularly around Puttasingh the graveyards of the ancestors have been destroyed. There is nowadays a move by nationalist Hindu groups to convert the Sora to Hinduism. This conflict has given rise to great tension in the area.</p>

    <h5 style="font-size: 24px;margin-bottom: 0;">Saura Paintings</h5><hr>
                <div class="image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Idital_Wall_Painting.jpg"class="space" height="300px" ALIGN="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*npmqzw6c7Pad2CPtdljP1w.jpeg"class="space" height="300px" ALIGN="Center"></div>
            <p class="para">Saura painting is a style of wall mural paintings associated with the Saura tribals of the state of Odisha in India. These paintings, also called ikons (or ekons) are visually similar to Warli paintings and hold religious significance for the Sauras.The Saura wall paintings are called Italons or Ikons (or Ekons) and are dedicated to Idital (also Edital) the main deity of the Sauras. These paintings draw upon tribal folklore and have ritualistic importance. Ikons make extensive use of symbolically pregnant icons that mirror the quotidian chores of the Sauras. People, horses, elephants, the sun and the moon and the tree of life are recurring motifs in these ikons. Ikons were originally painted on the walls of the Saura's adobe huts. The paintings' backdrop is prepared from red or yellow ochre earth which is then painted over using brushes fashioned from tender bamboo shoots. Ekons use natural dyes and chromes derived from ground white stone, hued earth, and vermilion and mixtures of tamarind seed, flower and leaf extracts.Ikons are worshipped during special religious and cultural occasions such as child-birth, harvest, marriage and the construction of a new house. Ikons are not commissioned frequently and an existing one can be regularly used for mundane rituals. The building of a new dwelling however necessitates the commissioning of an ekon, which is painted in a dark corner inside the home where its creation is accompanied by the recital of a specific set of prayers. Traditionally, Kudangs, the priestly class among the Sauras, painted the ikons since they also had the expertise to explain the symbolic import of the images contained therein to the villagers. Thus the ikons also became a part of the aural tradition of the Sauras that linked them to their traditions and customs. Today the Kudangs have been supplanted by artists and paintings are often executed in non-traditional locales.</p><br>
<h4 style="text-decoration: dashed;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 600;margin-bottom: 0;">Comparison with Warli Paintings:</h4><hr>
<p class="para">Saura paintings have a striking visual semblance to Warli art and both use clear geometric frames for their construction but they differ in both their style and treatment of subjects. In Saura paintings, a fish-net approach - of painting from the border inwards - is used while this not the case with Warli paintings.[1] Although both are examples of tribal pictographs that employ stick figures, Warli paintings use conjoint triangles to depict the human body while the figures are not as sharply delineated in Saura paintings. Also, unlike the Warli paintings where male and female icons are clearly distinguishable, in Saura art there is no such physical differentiation.</p>

                <!-- <div class="image"><img src="https://hyticos.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/gonds.jpg?w=640" height="300px"></div> -->
            <p class="para">The Saora depend upon land and forest for their subsistence. Their livelihood rests primarily on slash-and burn agriculture i.e., shifting cultivation and importantly on terrace cultivation. They are traditionally shifting cultivators and at the same time have expertise in terrace cultivation. Th exhibit a high degree of indigenous skill, ingenuity and technological outfit for preparing the terraces with inbuilt water management system. Mainly they grow rice in terraced fields and a variety of minor millets, cereals, and pulses in the swiddens.Every Saora village has a well-defined boundary and its inhabitants carry on shifting cultivation in the hills located within its boundary.Traditionally the hills are distributed on the basis of the birinda or extended family.  Members of a particular birinda used to have swiddens exclusively on one hill and no outsider was allowed to share it for shifting cultivation.The shifting land is called bag and the cultivation is called bagado chas. Each and every  family has a few patches of swiddens, either on the hill slopes or hill tops. The land itself, timber,fruit trees and game animals areas dear as life to the Saora.For shifting cultivation a hill slope is divided into several plots, demarcated and distributed for cultivation. The farmer who has been cultivating a particular plot of land continues to own it as long as he is capable of cultivating it.When he fails to do so, the plot is allotted to some one else who has needs. In no case are the plots left fallow nor is a plot already owned by one capable of cultivating it, allotted to anyone else. Thus, individual ownership of the swidden plots is recognized on a hereditary basis.A piece of land is used for cultivation for two to three years during which period different crops are sown in succession. Then the land is abandoned to recuperate. A mixed crop of cereals, minor millets and pulses succh as elusine corocana, penicum liliare, penicum italicum, sorghum vulgare, penisetum typhoideum, cjlanus cajan and dolichos biflorus are grown. This practice of growing mixed crops is dictated by their food habits and the ecological conditions. The shortenin of recuperative cycle, which is due to the shortage of land and population explosions has caused more damage to the swiddens.The Saora work the  soil using a hoe called a gubla.

<h5 style="text-decoration: dashed; font-weight: 600; font-size: 23px;">Challenges faced by Saura tribes:</h5> 
            <p class="para" >The Saura face numerous challenges that impact their social, economic, and cultural well-being. These challenges include land rights issues and displacement, leading to the disruption of their traditional way of life and livelihoods.</p>
    <ol>
        <li style="text-decoration: dashed; font-weight: 600;">Displacement and Land Rights::</li>
            <p class="para">Tribes often face displacement due to large-scale infrastructure projects like dams, mines, and industrial complexes. This leads to the loss of their traditional lands, livelihoods, and cultural identity. Many tribes also struggle to assert their land rights, leading to conflicts with authorities and other stakeholders.
            </p>
       <li style="text-decoration: dashed;font-weight: 600;">Healthcare and Education:</li>
            <p class="para">Access to quality healthcare and education is limited in tribal areas, leading to higher rates of maternal and infant mortality, malnutrition, and illiteracy among tribal communities. Lack of healthcare infrastructure and trained medical professionals exacerbates these issues.
            </p>
        <li style="text-decoration: dashed; font-weight: 600;">Exploitation and Vulnerability:</li>
            <p class="para">Tribes are vulnerable to exploitation by middlemen and traders who offer low prices for their forest produce and handicrafts. They often lack awareness of their legal rights and are subject to unfair labor practices and exploitation by non-tribal communities.
                .</p>
                <li style="text-decoration: dashed; font-weight: 600;">Poverty and Livelihoods:</li>
            <p class="para">Many tribal communities in Odisha live below the poverty line and struggle to meet their basic needs. Traditional livelihoods such as agriculture, forest-based activities, and handicrafts are increasingly under threat due to factors like deforestation, land degradation, and market competition.

                .</p>
                <li style="text-decoration: dashed; font-weight: 600;">Cultural Erosion:</li>
            <p class="para">Globalization and modernization pose a threat to tribal cultures and traditions.
