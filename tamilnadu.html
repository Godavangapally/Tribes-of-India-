      <hr>
     <p><br>Tribes of Tamil Nadu are mainly found in the district of Nilgiris. Of all the distinct tribes,
        the Kotas, the Todas, the Irulas, the Kurumbas and the Badagas form the larger groups,
        who mainly had a pastoral existence. The men from each family of this tribe are occupied
        in milking and grazing their large herds of buffaloes; a very common form of pastoral
        farming. This tribe is distinguished by their traditional costume; a thick white cotton
        cloth having stripes in red, blue or black, called puthukuli worn by both women and
        men over a waist cloth. They settle mainly in Munds, comprising of five-six typical
        wagon shaped, windowless split bamboo, reeds and thatch huts. They do not worship
        any God and their consciousness is cosmic.</p>

         <br>These tribes of Tamil Nadu occupy the lower slopes and forests at the base of the
         Nilgiri hills. This tribe is famous for snake catching and removing the venom. It is often
         said that the people of these tribes are called upon whenever a native require any
         medical / herbal assistance. They are the second largest group of tribes after the Badagas
         and they are largely similar to the Kurumba tribe of Tamil Nadu. This tribe produces
         honey, fruits, herbs, roots, gum, dyes etc., and trades them with the people in the plains.
