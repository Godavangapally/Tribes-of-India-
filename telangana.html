      <hr>
     <p><br>A state in southern part of india namely TELANGANA, has a rich and varied cultural history.It is the eleventh-largest state and the twevelth-most populated state in India as per 2011 census.On 2 June 2014, the area was separated from the northwestern part of United Andhra Pradesh as the newly formed state of Telangana, with Hyderabad as its capital.The word "Telinga" changed over time to "Telangana" and the name "Telangana" was designated to distinguish the predominantly Telugu-speaking region of the erstwhile Hyderabad State from its predominantly Marathi-speaking one, Marathwada. After Asaf Jahi's ceded the Seemandhra region to the British, the rest of the Telugu region retained the name Telangana and the other parts were called Madras Presidency's Circars and Ceded.Telangana is home to numerous notable tribes,each with their own culture and way of life.These tribes have distinctive traditions that have been handed down through the generations.The Gond, Koya, Lambada, and Banjara are notable tribes in Telangana. Over the years, these tribes have encountered several difficulties, such as land acquisition, displacement, and a loss of cultural identity. However, via several government initiatives and community-based programs, efforts are being undertaken to maintain their culture and give them more authority.</p>
