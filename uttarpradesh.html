      <hr>
     <p><br>Uttar Pradesh, with a deep historical legacy, has been home to diverse tribal communities. While the state is known for its predominantly non-tribal population, it does have smaller tribal groups, such as the Tharus, who primarily inhabit the Terai region. Uttar Pradesh has undertaken various initiatives for the welfare and development of these tribes, focusing on education, healthcare, and socio-economic upliftment. Efforts to preserve and promote the unique cultural heritage of tribal communities have been part of the state's commitment to inclusive development. However, it's essential to note that the tribal population in Uttar Pradesh is relatively small compared to other states, and their contributions to the cultural mosaic of the state are more localized. For detailed and updated information, consulting recent reports and studies on tribal communities in Uttar Pradesh is recommended.</p>
