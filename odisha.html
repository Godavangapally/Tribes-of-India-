      <hr>
     <p><br>Odisha is a state in eastern India. It is the 8th largest state by area, and the 11th largest by population. The state is bordered by the Bay of Bengal to the east, West Bengal to the north-east, Jharkhand to the north, Chhattisgarh to the west and north-west, and Andhra Pradesh to the south. Odisha is the 9th largest state by area in India, and the 11th largest by population. Odia is the official and most widely spoken language, spoken by 33.2 million according to the 2011 Census. The ancient kingdom of Kalinga, which was invaded by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka in 261 BCE resulting in the Kalinga War, coincides with the borders of modern-day Odisha. The modern state of Odisha was established on 1 April 1936, as a province in British India, and consisted predominantly of Odia-speaking regions. April 1 is therefore celebrated as Utkal Divas. The region is also known as Utkala and is mentioned in India's national anthem, "Jana Gana Mana". The history of Odisha has been documented in the Utkal Divasa, a book written by the Utkal Keshari Dr. Harekrushna Mahatab. The name of the state is derived from the ancient Prakrit word "Odda Visaya" (also "Udra Bibhasha" or "Odra Bibhasha") as in the Tirumalai inscription of Rajendra Chola I, which is dated to 1025. Sarala Das, who translated the Mahabharata into the Odia language in the 15th century, calls the region Odra Rashtra and Odisha. The inscriptions of Kapilendra Deva of the Gajapati Kingdom (1435‚Äì1466) on the walls of temples in Puri call the region Odisha or Odisha Rajya. The name of the state was changed from Orissa to Odisha, and the name of its language from Oriya to Odia, in 2011, by the passage of the Orissa (Alteration of Name) Bill, 2010 and the Constitution (113th Amendment) Bill, 2010 in the Parliament. After a brief debate, the lower house, Lok Sabha, passed the bill and amendment.
