            <p class="para">Kodo and Kutki are two millets that are consumed as a staple food.They also consume rice, but it is only during festivals or gatherings.They speak the Gondi language, which is an unwritten language from the Dravidian family.No marriage would take place between blood relatives. However, marriage between children of paternal aunts and maternal uncles was quite common.Work-life was the prerogative of men, with women doing household work. Women are treated with great respect and consulted in decision-making. However, there were some rituals and customs in which women could not take part. The Gond tribe culture revolved around traditional cottage industry practices like floor painting, pottery, and basket weaving.Men from the Gond tribe also practice stonework and woodwork. This is used in carving inscriptions on pillars, memorials, and decorations in palaces and religious places.The people from the Gond tribe are known for tattoos on their bodies.

<h5 style="text-decoration: dashed; font-weight: 600; font-size: 23px;">Challenges faced by Gond tribes:</h5> 
            <p class="para" >The Gonds face numerous challenges that impact their social, economic, and cultural well-being. These challenges include land rights issues and displacement, leading to the disruption of their traditional way of life and livelihoods.</p>
    <ol>
        <li style="text-decoration: dashed; font-weight: 600;">Linguistic Problems:</li>
            <p class="para">Of India‚Äôs total population, the population of the Gonds is 1,32,56,928 (around 1% of the Indian population).[1] Hira Singh Markam, President of the Gondwana Ganatantra Party claims that the actual number of Gondi speakers is around 2 crores because census was not conducted in the resident villages of the Gonds which were affected by Naxalite activities. The Gond Tribe constitutes about 13% of the total Scheduled Tribe (ST) population. In contrast to this, Gondi is the mother tongue of 29,84,453 people (around 25% of the official Gondi Population). What is even more disheartening is that today only 100 people can write in Gondi with accuracy.[2] This decreasing use of the language can be attributed to various factors like ridicule faced by those speaking in their native Gondi accent, increasing use of scheduled languages in Government offices etc. which have forced the Gonds to shift to Hindi or other local languages like those of Telugu, Marathi, Odia etc.</p>
       <li style="text-decoration: dashed;font-weight: 600;">Struggle for Representation and Recognition</li>
            <p class="para">The Gond tribe, in 2017-18 undertook a conflict with the Lambada Tribe (64% of the ST population of Telangana). The cause behind this violent outbreak was that the Lambada community had cornered a disproportionate portion of the reservations, pushing the Gonds and other tribes further down the socio-politico-economic level. Atram Bhujanga Rao, State Committee Vice-President of Telangana Human Rights Forum said that across Adilabad district, the nine Adivasi communities combined had lesser representation than the Lambada tribe alone. This was because, until August 27, 2020, the state didn‚Äôt have the authority to make sub-classification amongst the SCs and STs, but post the judgment under State of Punjab v. Davinder Singh and ors., the Supreme Court clarified that social realities couldn‚Äôt be ignored while the Constitution aims at the comprehensive removal of the disparities. The court also recognized that STs are not a homogenous group and therefore, the state government has the power to create sub-categorizations amongst them. This judgment has the potential to allow the state to take steps in furtherance of the constitutional goals of equality and inclusivity. The Adivasi Sankshema Parishad (ASP) has started an online campaign on various social media platforms to gather support for its long-standing demand of including the Gondi language in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution in 2020.</p>
        <li style="text-decoration: dashed; font-weight: 600;">Modern Challenges</li>
            <p class="para">Economic disparities and limited access to education and healthcare contribute to their socio-economic marginalization and perpetuate cycles of poverty. Rapid modernization and external influences pose a risk to Gond culture, with the younger generation becoming disconnected from their heritage. Environmental degradation threatens their close relationship with the natural environment and traditional livelihoods. Moreover, social discrimination and limited representation hinder their social mobility and participation in decision-making processes. Efforts are underway to address these challenges, including land rights movements, educational initiatives, healthcare interventions, and cultural preservation efforts. By focusing on sustainable development and empowering the Gond community, it is hoped that their well-being and rights can be safeguarded for future generations.</p>

             <p class="para" style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 20px;">Nature worship plays a central role, with reverence for deities like Bura Deo (Earth God) and Rani Parvati (Forest Goddess).</p>
