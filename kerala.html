      <hr>
     <p><br>Kerala  called Keralam in Malayalam, is a state on the Malabar Coast of India. It was formed on 1 November 1956, following the passage of the States Reorganisation Act, by combining Malayalam-speaking regions of the erstwhile regions of Cochin, Malabar, South Canara, and Travancore.Spread over 38,863 km2 (15,005 sq mi), Kerala is the 21st largest Indian state by area. It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Seato the west. With 33 million inhabitants as per the 2011 census, Kerala is the 13th-largest Indian state by population. It is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram. Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state.The Tribal dances of Kerala are a unique example of how isolated communities preserve their customs and manners. While it may seem that the tribal dances have disappeared from Kerala, there are still a few hamlets where they can be seen. Every tribe presents their own unique dance traditions, all of which have been preserved because of the people‚Äôs life.The tribals of Kerala are the original people who have inhabited the forests and mountains of Western Ghats. Destined to live outside of the modernising world, they have continued their age-old traditions and folk-ways.The Kerala tribals are truly no different from other tribes across India. There are three groups of Kerala‚Äôs tribal population. They are the vulnerable, the marginalised, and the minority. There are 4,848,393 tribals (1.5% of the total population).In 2001, the Census of India recorded 3,64,189 Scheduled Tribes in Kerala. Wayanad had the highest number of tribals of any district in the state (1,36,062). .</p>
